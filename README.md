#A software bind in JavaFX and C++ for day to day Database Management . 
#This software is a revolutionary Open-Source Software for Database Management.
#Here are the Goals of this software
#1) I have implemented the loading screen of the software . 
But , I have removed the window borders , we need to implement       
only minimize and close buttons . Rich GUI for these two buttons are a must and it must be simple.
#2) The Loading screen is made .  
We need to develop a code that will implement a swipe function. 
The explanation is while at the loading pane , we will just scroll our mouse to visit the next pane .
And the panes must be swapped in the same window , not different windows.
                                                        That's it for now.
